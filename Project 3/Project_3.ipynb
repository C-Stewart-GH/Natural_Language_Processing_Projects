After a few more guesses and light hinting, she was able to guess the correct book. I don't believe she was able to guess the correct book because she reads many murder mystery books and the first few sentences are not that specific. The interesting takeaway was how much insight she was able to obtain from such a small amount of information. She had a sense it was a murder mystery genre novel about a husband and wife from just 7 words. I imagine with a few more sentences that she would have been able to correctly guess on the first attempt."
