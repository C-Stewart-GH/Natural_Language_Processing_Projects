    "To normalize vocabulary size between 0 and 1, we would ideally have a large sample of book vocabulary sizes to reference. Since we do not, I searched for examples on the internet to find the estimated min and max. Based on findings from this site (https://www.grammarly.com/blog/7-novels-to-read-for-a-better-vocabulary/#:~:text=Ulysses,English%20novels%20of%20all%20time.), Ulysses is one of the most difficult novels to read and represents near the 'max' for unique words in an English novel at 30,030 unique words. We will use this as our max to normalize our vocabulary size scale. I did not find a good source for the minimum, but did find the a minimum word count for a novel to be ~40,000. Based on this, I will estimate my lower bound of vocabulary size to be 2,500. We will normalize the studied book's vocabulary size between the defined min and max values. There is also an boundary checker to ensure that rare books outside this range can't fall outside of 0 and 1."

Once again for the normalization, we would prefer to have a large sample to help us define the min and max values of long word vocabulary size. Without this and no clear reference list online, I made a subjective decision to set the min to 40 and the max to 800. This should be updated when more data is collected. Also, a potential concern that should be monitored is that hyphenated words are currently included."

    "The text difficulty score follows a trend with the reading scores in my examples unlike the lexical diversity alone in the last HW. This is only a single sample size at each reading level, so we should proceed with caution assuming this methodology is effective. With a larger sample size for each reading level, we could refine the min and max normalization values for the normalized vocabulary size and normalized long word vocabulary size functions. We could also refine the weights for the inputs of the lexical diversity, normalized vocabulary size, and normalized long word vocabulary size functions. Overall, the findings show this method to be a more balanced approach to evaluating text difficulty than lexical diversity alone by balancing text length, vocabulary, and frequent use of more complex vocabulary."
