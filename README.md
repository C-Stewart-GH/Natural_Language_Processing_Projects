# Natural Language Processing Projects

**Contributors: Cameron Stewart**

>The projects in this repository increasingly dive deeper into Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts to gather insight. The purpose of these projects was purely academic to explore tools to scrape data from websites and apply NLP analysis.

## Project 1 - Analyze Books by Reading Level

[Project 1](../main/Project%201/Project_1.ipynb)

This project looks at the interaction between lexical diversity and vocabulary size at multiple reading levels. The text was tokenized using Python's NLTK package. Books analyzed were found at: [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/215).

## Project 2 - Create Text Difficulty Score

[Project 2](../main/Project%202/Project_2.ipynb)

This project develops a normalized score for both the vocabulary size of text and the long word vocabulary size of text. Using the mean of these normalized scores, I developed a text difficulty score that was tested across multiple reading levels. The project showed the created text difficulty score increased with the reading level. The text was tokenized using Python's NLTK package. Books analyzed were found at: [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/215).

## Project 3 - Comparing sentence outputs of Stemming and Lemmatizing

[Project 3](../main/Project%203/Project_3.ipynb)

This is a simple project with two parts. Part 1 - Stemmed Book Titles were tested for interpretability with another user. Part 2 - Compare in terms of % difference in examples when you stem vs. lemmatize text.
