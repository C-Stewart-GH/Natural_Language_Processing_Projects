## Project 1 - Analyze Books by Reading Level

[Project 1](../main/Project%201/Project_1.ipynb)

This project looks at the interaction between lexical diversity and vocabulary size at multiple reading levels. The text was tokenized using Python's NLTK package. Books analyzed were found at: [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/215).
